===

### firmware:

Hemisphere Suite is an open-source project by Jason Justian (aka chysn)
The Logarhythm branch by Logarhythm1 adds some nice tweaks and two amazing applets (TB-3P0 and Stairs)

### ornament & crime:
ornament**s** & crime**s** is a collaborative project by Patrick Dowling (aka pld), mxmxmx and Tim Churches (aka bennelong.bicyclist) (though mostly by pld and bennelong.bicyclist). it **(considerably) extends** the original firmware for the o_C / ASR eurorack module, designed by mxmxmx.
