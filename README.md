Hemisphere Suite: Alternate Alternate Firmware for Ornament and Crime (Nandemo)
===

### new stuff (in-progress):

Nose - A simple noise generator. Static and CV shaped channels. (Applet)

Crash - CV bitcrusher based on Dr. Crusher. (Applet)

Brownie - An attempt at a simple walking algorithm. Not finished. Not particularly musical either. (Applet)

Popcorn - 4 channel Euclidean trigger generator. Needs a bunch of UI work but it's fun. (Application)

Juggler - Weird 3-way switch that can pass CV (Independently on B, C, and D, and sequentially? mixed? on A). There's a gated out mode too. Not sure where I'm going with this yet (Application)



### firmware:

Hemisphere Suite is an open-source project by Jason Justian (aka chysn)

The Logarhythm branch by Logarhythm1 adds some nice tweaks and two amazing applets (TB-3P0 and Stairs)


### ornament & crime:
ornament**s** & crime**s** is a collaborative project by Patrick Dowling (aka pld), mxmxmx and Tim Churches (aka bennelong.bicyclist) (though mostly by pld and bennelong.bicyclist). it **(considerably) extends** the original firmware for the o_C / ASR eurorack module, designed by mxmxmx.
